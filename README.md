ECMAScript 2018+ introduction
- This is not a complete list of all features, only the really cool ones that I heavily use
- You can find a good overview here: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
- The new ECMAScript specs are fully compatible with the "old" JavaScript, so old code will continue working
- I provided explanation for each feature on why it's good to use
- I also provided links to eslint rules that contain more explanation on the usage and advantage of those features
